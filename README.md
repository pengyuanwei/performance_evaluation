This repository provides a program for evaluating PC computing performance:

1. Check if CuPy is successfully installed.
2. Test the data transfer speed between the CPU and GPU in the PyTorch framework.
3. Dual Graphics: Test the data transfer speed between the CPU and a specific GPU in the PyTorch framework.
4. Dual Graphics: Test the data transfer speed between two GPUs in the PyTorch framework.
